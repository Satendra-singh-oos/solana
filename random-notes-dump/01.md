## What is Solana 
- Public Blockchai like etherum used to devlop to build any web3 appplication. transection fee is slow, secure and Fast Confiramtion Time.

- Blockchain is decentrized way to store data so that no one can edit the data.
- If you worte the smart contract and put it on the blockchain and asume it is falty now you can't re edit it.
- Solana work on POH(proof of history , we store time stamp in the node insted of data )


## Use Case

-  Like finace base application(trading market , crowd funding platform, ecom )



## Program(Smart-Contrat)
- Rust,C,C++

## Transaction

- there are 2 thing 

Signature (it is like patym transfer which have your bank upi id and recevire upi id,)
[An Array of signatures of private keys and secret phrases(users) made for transaction]

Message [information that we sen to the program(smart-cotnract)]

-> what type of inforamtion mwessage have

1) Header-> (information about the hash of signatures and red-only accounts w/o signature)
2) Account Addresses-> (Array of addresses of accounts that we are going to interact with)
3) Recent Blockhash-> (hash of the last observed blockchain ledger)
4) Instruction -> An array of data used by smart-contract to complete the transaction as per logic

## Instruction
-> contains of following thing

1) ProgramID(SmartContractId)-> The smart contract id where the transation will interact with.
2) Accounts-> Array of accounts which contains state inforamation for the users
3) Data-> Byte array of data the program will use to hanle each transection

-> EX: Think about a for recharege you wifi the data will contain the wifi.no ,ammount of recharege , vendor name
programId will contains the the ID FOR THE Smart Contract for Reachare 
Account will contains all the information of the history transection


## Accounts 
- Acounts keep track of the state on solana program.
- stored on the blockchain similar to a file on your hard drive

- account will contain all your information regarding your private key whever you to transection for the first time your acccount will get created

-> contains of following thing

1) Signer: Signature of teh user giving authorization to execute the transection (like in web2 we have otp)
2) Read-only: Indicate if data in the account can be modified.(it only that this data of account is not able to modified only read)
3) Executable: Account created at the deployment of the smart cotnract.Only executable accounts can process instruction.All additional user accounts must be owned by the executable account.
(Account for the smart contacte which is eventualy caleed as program id )
4) Rent: Lamport(SOL) that user pay to keep the account on the program(smartcontract).when it reached 0,the account is removed.it's also possible to be rent exempred
(basically a transection fee )
5) Data: Seralized metadata that allows users to store custom data in the account on the blockchain




``` solana config```

``` solana config set --url devnet```


## Rust 

-> to impore library
```
use <librabry_name>::{}
```

cargo build-bpf (given by solna to comiple your program in binary so it can deploy in the solana blockchain)
